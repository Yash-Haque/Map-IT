# Map-IT
A small program inspired from the project in Automating The Boring Stuff With Python

I work at a place where every now and then I need to look up locations from the entried data and verify the location through map.
Map-IT therefore is an initiative for me to fast track my tedious work of going through every entry verifying the address.

TODO:
  > Add a dictionary of locations of the country which the data is is made of
  > Add Regex to better orient each input
  > Automate
